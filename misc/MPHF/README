Generate mininal perfect hashtable in C++ code.

---------------------------

######Disclaimer:
The MPHF generator was originally written by Bob Jekins using his mininal perfect hash algorithm.

######File Description:
Input/				- Input directory, where you put your definition files of keys and static values.
Output/				- output directory, all generated mphf class and cpp table will be putted here. 
compile.cmd			- Compile the perfect hash generator(You don't have to necessarily run this since I've already included the generator's bianry file).
generate_cpp.cmd	- Generate hashtable's cpp codes.
clean.cmd			- Clean up leftovers.

---------------------------

###### How To Use:
0. Before you used hit You must have GNU compiler installed on your computer(Be sure to check you have the GNU Make installed and be in your SYSTEM PATH as well)

1. Compile RenderCraft in debug mode then run it. Grab the following 4 files under your WC3's directory and put them into Input/
	NormalMap_keys.txt
	NormalMap_vals.txt
	ShadowVolume_keys.txt
	ShadowVolume_vals.txt

2. Run generate_cpp.cmd

3. Copy the following files to {project_root}/src/mphf/
	npHash.h
	npHash.c
	svHash.h
	svHash.c

4. Copy the generated codes from Output/sv_cpp.txt and place them into {project_root}/src/ShadowData.cpp to replace the old codes.

5. Copy the generated codes from Output/np_cpp.txt and place them into {project_root}/src/NormalMapData.cpp to replace the old codes.

6. All done! Now you can compile RenderCraft to see if it works.
